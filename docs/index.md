scarval is responsible for randomly terminating instances in production to ensure that engineers implement their services to be resilient to instance failures.

See [how to deploy](How-to-deploy) for instructions on how to get up and running with scarval.

Once you're up and running, see [configuring behavior via Spinnaker](Configuring-behavior-via-Spinnaker) for how users can customize the behavior of scarval for their apps.
